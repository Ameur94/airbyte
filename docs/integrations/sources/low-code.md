# Low-code

This doc is currently used for changelog purposes only internally, so that we can make sure that the source stays
up-to-date with the latest version of the CDK. The doc is hidden from the docs site.

The changelog below is automatically updated by the `bump_version` command as part of the Airbyte CDK publish flow.
