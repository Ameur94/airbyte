# Quickstart 

You can start exploring Airbyte in just a few steps! This page will guide you through setting up and running an instance of our Community OSS (Open Source Software) locally. To learn more about options you have for putting Airbyte's Open Source Software into production, refer to our guides on [deploying Airbyte](https://docs.airbyte.com/category/deploy-airbyte). 

Afterward, we'll point you to the docs you'll need to learn how to setup your first connection and share some great resources for learning more about Airbyte.

Remember, you can always jump right into using **[Airbyte Cloud](https://cloud.airbyte.com/signup)** instead of exploring with a local deployment. Once you sign up, you'll begin a 14-day free trial. 

Learn more about what differentiates Airbyte Cloud by visiting our **[feature comparison page](https://airbyte.com/product/features)**.

## Preparation
The first step to deploying locally is getting set up with Docker.

- Install `Docker Desktop` \(see instructions for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) on the Docker website\).
- Next, you'll need to enable `Kubernetes` via the Docker Desktop UI \(see [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)\).

## Installation
Choose your operating system to proceed with Airbyte setup: 
- [MacOS](/getting-started/quickstart-mac)
- [Linux and Windows](/getting-started/quickstart-linux-and-windows)
