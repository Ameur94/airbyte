        message:
          Stream state will be saved for every board in stream `Boards Issues`.
          Customers who use stream `Board Issues` in Incremental Sync mode must take
          action with their connections.

      2.0.0:
        message:
          The source Jira connector is being migrated from the Python CDK to
          our declarative low-code CDK. Due to changes to the incremental stream state,
          this migration constitutes a breaking change. Additionally, an issue in
          the `ProjectAvatars` stream has been fixed. After updating, please reset
          your source before resuming syncs. For more information, see our migration
          documentation for source Jira.
